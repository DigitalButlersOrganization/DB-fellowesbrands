> #### &#x2757; Windows Makefile
> To run a Makefile in the terminal on Windows, 
you need to install the GNU Make utility.
<br/> You can download the GNU Make installer for Windows 
from the official website at https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/make/3.81/make-3.81.exe/download
<br/> After downloading and installing GNU Make, 
you can open a terminal (such as Command Prompt or PowerShell), 
navigate to the directory containing the Makefile, and run the 
`make` command.

## #1 Install
`make install` or `'npm install/ci'` or `'yarn install/ci'`

## #2 Start
`make serve` or `npm serve` or `yarn serve`

## #3 Format (prettier + autoprefixer) 
`make format` or `npm format` or `yarn format`
